> | product_id  | int     |  
> | low_fats    | enum    |  
> | recyclable  | enum    |  
>   
> - `product_id` is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.  
> - `low_fats` is an `ENUM` (category) of type `('Y', 'N')` where `'Y'` means this product is low fat and `'N'` means it is not.  
> - `recyclable` is an `ENUM` (category) of types `('Y', 'N')` where `'Y'` means this product is recyclable and `'N'` means it is not.  
>   
> **Problem Statement:**

>   
> | id |

> **Explanation:**  
> CROSS JOIN: We perform a CROSS JOIN between the Students and Subjects tables to ensure that each student is paired with every subject, even if they haven't attended any exams for that subject.  
> LEFT JOIN: We then use a LEFT JOIN to link this full list of student-subject combinations to the Examinations table. This ensures that even if a student has not attended an exam for a subject, the student-subject pair will still appear in the results.  
> COUNT: We count how many times each student attended the exam for each subject using COUNT(e.subject_name). If a student did not attend an exam for a particular subject, the count will be 0.  
> GROUP BY and ORDER BY: Finally, we group the results by student_id and subject_name to aggregate the exam attendances, and order the output by these columns for a clear and organized result.

  <summary>570. Managers with at Least 5 Direct Reports</summary>  

> **Table: Employee**  
>  
> | Column Name | Type    |  
> |-------------|---------|  
> | id          | int     |  
> | name        | varchar |  
> | department  | varchar |  
> | managerId   | int     |  
>  
> id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.  
> Each row of this table indicates the name of an employee, their department, and the id of their manager.  
> If managerId is null, then the employee does not have a manager.  
> No employee will be the manager of themself.  
>  
> **Problem Statement:**  
> Write a solution to find managers with at least five direct reports.  
> Return the result table in any order.  
>  
> **Solution:**  
>  
> ```sql  
> SELECT m.name  
> FROM Employee as m  
> LEFT JOIN Employee as e   
>     ON m.id = e.managerId  
> GROUP BY e.managerId  
> HAVING COUNT(e.managerId) >= 5;  
> ```  
>  
> **Output:**  
>  
> | name |  
> |------|  
> | John |  
>  
> **Explanation:**  
> - The query joins the `Employee` table with itself to count how many employees each manager (identified by `managerId`) directly supervises.  
> - We group the results by `e.managerId` and use the `HAVING` clause to filter only those managers who have 5 or more direct reports.  
> - The `LEFT JOIN` ensures that managers with no employees reporting to them are still considered, though filtered out by the `HAVING` clause.

> **Explanation:**  
> - The query joins the `Signups` table with the `Confirmations` table to count how many confirmation requests each user made and how many were successfully confirmed.  
> - For each user, we calculate the confirmation rate by dividing the number of 'confirmed' messages by the total number of confirmation messages.

> If a product does not have any sold units, its average selling price is assumed to be 0.  
> Return the result table in any order.

>  
> **Explanation:**  
> - The query calculates the average selling price for each product by multiplying the price by the units sold for the respective date range and dividing by the total number of units sold.  
> - The `IFNULL` ensures that if no units were sold for a product, the `average_price` is set to 0.
