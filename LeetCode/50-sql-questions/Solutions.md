> | product_id  | int     |  
> | low_fats    | enum    |  
> | recyclable  | enum    |  
>   
> - `product_id` is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.  
> - `low_fats` is an `ENUM` (category) of type `('Y', 'N')` where `'Y'` means this product is low fat and `'N'` means it is not.  
> - `recyclable` is an `ENUM` (category) of types `('Y', 'N')` where `'Y'` means this product is recyclable and `'N'` means it is not.  
>   
> **Problem Statement:**  
> Write a solution to find the IDs of products that are both low fat and recyclable.  
> Return the result table in any order.

>   
> | id |  
> |----|

> **Explanation:**  
> CROSS JOIN: We perform a CROSS JOIN between the Students and Subjects tables to ensure that each student is paired with every subject, even if they haven't attended any exams for that subject.  
> LEFT JOIN: We then use a LEFT JOIN to link this full list of student-subject combinations to the Examinations table. This ensures that even if a student has not attended an exam for a subject, the student-subject pair will still appear in the results.  
> COUNT: We count how many times each student attended the exam for each subject using COUNT(e.subject_name). If a student did not attend an exam for a particular subject, the count will be 0.  
> GROUP BY and ORDER BY: Finally, we group the results by student_id and subject_name to aggregate the exam attendances, and order the output by these columns for a clear and organized result.

  <summary>570. Managers with at Least 5 Direct Reports</summary>

> Each row of this table indicates the name of an employee, their department, and the id of their manager.  
> If managerId is null, then the employee does not have a manager.  
> No employee will be the manager of themself.  
>  
> **Problem Statement:**  
> Write a solution to find managers with at least five direct reports.

>  
> **Output:**

>  
> **Explanation:**  
> - The query joins the `Employee` table with itself to count how many employees each manager (identified by `managerId`) directly supervises.  
> - We group the results by `e.managerId` and use the `HAVING` clause to filter only those managers who have 5 or more direct reports.

  <summary>2356. Number of Unique Subjects Taught by Each Teacher</summary>  

> **Table: Teacher**  
>  
> | Column Name | Type |  
> |-------------|------|  
> | teacher_id  | int  |  
> | subject_id  | int  |  
> | dept_id     | int  |  
>  
> (subject_id, dept_id) is the primary key (combinations of columns with unique values) of this table.  
> Each row in this table indicates that the teacher with teacher_id teaches the subject subject_id in the department dept_id.  
>  
> **Problem Statement:**  
> Write a solution to calculate the number of unique subjects each teacher teaches in the university.  
> Return the result table in any order.  
>  
> **Solution:**  
>  
> ```sql  
> SELECT t.teacher_id, COUNT(DISTINCT t.subject_id) as cnt  
> FROM Teacher as t  
> GROUP BY t.teacher_id;  
> ```  
>  
> **Output:**  
>  
> | teacher_id | cnt |  
> |------------|-----|  
> | 1          | 2   |  
> | 2          | 4   |  
>  
> **Explanation:**  
> - The query groups the data by `teacher_id` to count how many distinct `subject_id` values each teacher is teaching.  
> - The `DISTINCT` keyword ensures that only unique subjects are counted for each teacher.  
> - The `COUNT` function calculates the number of distinct subjects per teacher, and the results are grouped by each teacher's ID.

  <summary>1141. User Activity for the Past 30 Days I</summary>  

> **Table: Activity**  
>  
> | Column Name   | Type    |  
> |---------------|---------|  
> | user_id       | int     |  
> | session_id    | int     |  
> | activity_date | date    |  
> | activity_type | enum    |  
>  
> This table may have duplicate rows.  
> The `activity_type` column is an ENUM (category) of type ('open_session', 'end_session', 'scroll_down', 'send_message').  
> The table shows the user activities for a social media website. Each session belongs to exactly one user.  
>  
> **Problem Statement:**  
> Write a solution to find the daily active user count for a period of 30 days ending 2019-07-27 inclusively. A user was active on any day if they made at least one activity on that day.  
> Return the result table in any order.  
>  
> **Solution:**  
>  
> ```sql  
> SELECT activity_date AS DAY,  
>        count(DISTINCT user_id) AS active_users  
> FROM Activity  
> WHERE activity_date > date_sub('2019-07-27', interval 30 DAY)  
>   AND activity_date <= '2019-07-27'  
> GROUP BY DAY;  
> ```  
>  
> **Output:**  
>  
> | DAY        | active_users |  
> |------------|--------------|  
> | 2019-07-20 | 2            |  
> | 2019-07-21 | 2            |  
>  
> **Explanation:**  
> - The query retrieves data for a 30-day window ending on '2019-07-27'.  
> - For each day in the given period, the query counts the distinct number of users (`user_id`) who were active on that day.  
> - The `GROUP BY` ensures that we get the user count for each specific day (`activity_date`).  
> - The `DISTINCT` keyword ensures that each user is counted only once per day, regardless of the number of activities.
