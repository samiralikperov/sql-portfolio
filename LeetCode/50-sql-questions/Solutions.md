> |-------------|---------|  
> | product_id  | int     |  
> | low_fats    | enum    |  
> | recyclable  | enum    |  
>   
> - `product_id` is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.  
> - `low_fats` is an `ENUM` (category) of type `('Y', 'N')` where `'Y'` means this product is low fat and `'N'` means it is not.  
> - `recyclable` is an `ENUM` (category) of types `('Y', 'N')` where `'Y'` means this product is recyclable and `'N'` means it is not.  
>   
> **Problem Statement:**  
> Write a solution to find the IDs of products that are both low fat and recyclable.  
> Return the result table in any order.  
> The result format is in the following example.  
> 
> **Solution:**
> 
> ```sql

> | product_id |  
> |------------|  
> | 1          |  
> | 3          |  
>   
> **Explanation:**  
> - The query selects the `product_id` from the `Products` table.  
> - It uses the `WHERE` clause to filter the rows where both `low_fats` and `recyclable` columns have the value `'Y'`.  
> - This ensures that only products that are both low fat and recyclable are returned.

>   
> | id |  
> |----|  
> | 4  |  
> | 7  |  
>   
> **Explanation:**  
> - The query selects distinct `author_id` from the `Views` table where the `author_id` is the same as `viewer_id`.  
> - This condition checks if an author has viewed their own article.

> - `machine_id`: The ID of the machine.  
> - `process_id`: The ID of the process running on the machine.  
> - `activity_type`: An ENUM of either `'start'` or `'end'`, indicating the beginning and end of a process.  
> - `timestamp`: A float representing the time in seconds when the activity occurred.  
> 
> **Problem Statement:**  
> Write a solution to find the average time each machine takes to complete a process.  
> The time for a process is calculated by subtracting the 'start' timestamp from the 'end' timestamp.  
> The result should include the `machine_id` and the average processing time, rounded to 3 decimal places.
> 
> **Solution:**
> 
> ```sql
> SELECT

> | 2          | 1.456           |
>
> **Explanation:**
>
> The query joins the Activity table to itself to match the start and end times of each process.
> It then calculates the time difference between the 'start' and 'end' timestamps for each process.
> The result is grouped by machine_id, and the average processing time for each machine is returned.
> The AVG function calculates the average processing time for each machine, and the ROUND function rounds it to 3 decimal places.

> **Explanation:**  
> CROSS JOIN: We perform a CROSS JOIN between the Students and Subjects tables to ensure that each student is paired with every subject, even if they haven't attended any exams for that subject.  
> LEFT JOIN: We then use a LEFT JOIN to link this full list of student-subject combinations to the Examinations table. This ensures that even if a student has not attended an exam for a subject, the student-subject pair will still appear in the results.  
> COUNT: We count how many times each student attended the exam for each subject using COUNT(e.subject_name). If a student did not attend an exam for a particular subject, the count will be 0.  
> GROUP BY and ORDER BY: Finally, we group the results by student_id and subject_name to aggregate the exam attendances, and order the output by these columns for a clear and organized result.
