  <summary> 1757. Recyclable and Low Fat Products</summary> 

> **Table: Products**  
>   
> | Column Name | Type    |  
> |-------------|---------|  
> | product_id  | int     |  
> | low_fats    | enum    |  
> | recyclable  | enum    |  
>   
> - `product_id` is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.  
> - `low_fats` is an `ENUM` (category) of type `('Y', 'N')` where `'Y'` means this product is low fat and `'N'` means it is not.  
> - `recyclable` is an `ENUM` (category) of types `('Y', 'N')` where `'Y'` means this product is recyclable and `'N'` means it is not.  
>   
> **Problem Statement:**  
> Write a solution to find the IDs of products that are both low fat and recyclable.  
> Return the result table in any order.  
> The result format is in the following example.  

> **Solution:**

> ```sql  
> SELECT  
>     product_id  
> FROM Products  
> WHERE low_fats = 'Y'   -- Filters only products that are low fat  
>   AND recyclable = 'Y'; -- Filters only products that are recyclable  
> ```  
>   
> **Output:**  
>   
> | product_id |  
> |------------|  
> | 1          |  
> | 3          |  
>   
> **Explanation:**  
> - The query selects the `product_id` from the `Products` table.  
> - It uses the `WHERE` clause to filter the rows where both `low_fats` and `recyclable` columns have the value `'Y'`.  
> - This ensures that only products that are both low fat and recyclable are returned.

  <summary> 584. Find Customer Referee</summary> 

> **Table: Customer**  
>   
> | Column Name | Type    |  
> |-------------|---------|  
> | id          | int     |  
> | name        | varchar |  
> | referee_id  | int     |  
>   
> - `id` is the primary key column for this table.  
> - Each row of this table indicates the `id` of a customer, their `name`, and the `id` of the customer who referred them.  
>   
> **Problem Statement:**  
> Find the names of the customers that are not referred by the customer with `id = 2`.  
> Return the result table in any order.  
> The result format is in the following example.  

> **Solution:**

> ```sql  
> SELECT name  
> FROM Customer  
> WHERE 1=1
> AND referee_id IS NULL -- Filters customers who were not referred
> OR referee_id != 2;  -- by customer with id = 2 or have no referee 
> ```  
>   
> **Output:**  
>   
> | name |  
> |------|  
> | Will |  
> | Jane |  
> | Bill |  
> | Zack |  
>   
> **Explanation:**  
> - The query selects the `name` from the `Customer` table.  
> - It uses the `WHERE` clause to filter rows where `referee_id` is either `NULL` or not equal to `2`.  
> - This ensures that only customers who are not referred by the customer with `id = 2` are returned.

  <summary> 595. Big Countries</summary> 

> **Table: World**  
>   
> | Column Name | Type    |  
> |-------------|---------|  
> | name        | varchar |  
> | continent   | varchar |  
> | area        | int     |  
> | population  | int     |  
> | gdp         | bigint  |  
>   
> - `name` is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.  
> - Each row of this table gives information about the name of a country, the continent to which it belongs, its area, the population, and its GDP value.  
>   
> **Problem Statement:**  
> A country is considered big if:  
> - it has an area of at least three million (i.e., 3000000 kmÂ²), or  
> - it has a population of at least twenty-five million (i.e., 25000000).  
> Write a solution to find the `name`, `population`, and `area` of the big countries.  
> Return the result table in any order.  
> The result format is in the following example.  

> **Solution:**

> ```sql  
> SELECT name, population, area  
> FROM World  
> WHERE area >= 3000000 OR population >= 25000000;  -- Filters countries with area >= 3,000,000 or population >= 25,000,000  
> ```  
>   
> **Output:**  
>   
> | name        | population | area    |  
> |-------------|------------|---------|  
> | Afghanistan | 25500100   | 652230  |  
> | Algeria     | 37100000   | 2381741 |  
>   
> **Explanation:**  
> - The query selects the `name`, `population`, and `area` from the `World` table.  
> - It uses the `WHERE` clause to filter the rows where either `area` is greater than or equal to `3000000` or `population` is greater than or equal to `25000000`.  
> - This ensures that only the big countries are returned.
