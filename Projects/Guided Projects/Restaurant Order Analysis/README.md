# Restaurant Order Analysis
## Project Overview
This project, authored by [Samir Alikperov](https://www.linkedin.com/in/samiralikperov/), focuses on analyzing restaurant order data using Python and SQL. The primary objectives are to demonstrate effective integration between Python and a MySQL database, automate data management tasks, and perform comprehensive data analysis.

### The key steps in this project include:

- Setting up a connection to a MySQL database.
- Executing SQL scripts to create and populate tables with restaurant order data.
- Using Python functions to execute SQL queries and retrieve data as pandas DataFrames.
- Performing data analysis and visualization to gain insights into the restaurant's menu and order trends.
- Utilizing interactive tools like dtale to explore the data in a user-friendly way.

This [notebook](MA_Restaurant_Order_Analysis.ipynb) showcases a complete workflow, from data extraction to visualization, providing a practical example of using data analytics to drive decision-making in the restaurant industry.
